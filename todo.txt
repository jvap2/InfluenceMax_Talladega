-See if we can utilize cuRipples for comparison

-Get scalar Sparse MatVec Mult to work, then try vector kernel

-The random initialization needs to have information passed in between the vectors

-The pagerank version does not need information exchange

-Does terrible with Arvix Data set

- The parameters we want to tune and examine include streams, K, damping factor, and threshold

- The measurements we want from this include percentage of flow and time

- Need to add to the python files to deal with the flow measurements

- See what other influence algorithms networkx has at least
